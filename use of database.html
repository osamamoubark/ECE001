<h3>*Databases for Businesses:</h3>The business world depends on databases 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Inventory, order processing, payroll, accounting, shipping and transportation routing are often tracked within a main database that keeps the company functioning.
<h3>*Databases for Non-Profits:</h3>Like businesses and educational institutions, non-profit organizations use systems to track information. Many charities and other non-profit groups use a database to store details of donations, volunteers, hours served in the community, clients helped and other information related to the organization.
<h3>*Databases for Household and Family Management:</h3>The database also has a role in household and family management. Many people use databases to keep track of family birthdays, bills and expenses in the home; addresses of friends and relatives and movie/DVD collections.
<h3>*Everyday Uses For Databases:</h3>Each time you make a purchase and the sales clerk asks for your address or ZIP code, your information is kept and stored on a customer database. These collections of data are used to send mailings of special offers, discounts and other deals.
