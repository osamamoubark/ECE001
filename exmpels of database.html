<h3>exmpels:</h3>Let us see a simple example of a university database. This database is maintaining information concerning students, courses, and grades in a university environment. The database is organized as five files:

The STUDENT file stores data of each student
The COURSE file stores contain data on each course.
The SECTION stores the information about sections in a particular course.
The GRADE file stores the grades which students receive in the various sections
The TUTOR file contains information about each professor.
To define a database system:

We need to specify the structure of the records of each file by defining the different types of data elements to be stored in each record.
We can also use a coding scheme to represent the values of a data item.
Basically, your Database will have 5 tables with a foreign key defined amongst the various tables.
